# DD2434 Machine Learning, Advanced Course 2019 
This repository contains the code templates for Assignment 2. 
There are data simulation codes, helper functions and the solution templates for students.

Check Tree.py and tree_example_folder to see example usages of tree / tree-mixture generators. Note that you don't have to use this code in your solutions.

## List of Questions
**2.3 Likelihood of a tree GM only for E level**

There are three different trees in 2.3/data folder. Each tree has 5 samples. Calculate the likelihood of each sample and report them.

**2.5 Likelihood of a tree GM**

There are three different tree mixtures in 2.5/data folder. Run EM algorithm. Compare the real and inferred mixtures in terms of Robinson-Foulds metric and likelihood.  

**2.6 Super epicentra - EM**
Complete the code in 2_6.py. There are two datasets concerning mixture models with 2 and 3 numbers of components (the code for data generation is in the same file).
Explain the plots in how they make sense.

**2.8 Sampling from a tree GM**
